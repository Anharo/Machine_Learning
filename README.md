## Machine_Learning
This is the machine learning repository of my learning stages. Here i am gonna put all my codes which i will do while studying machine learning. I have studied from youtbe channel "Code Basics" This is his youtube channel " https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3uvCeTYTeyfe0-rN5r8zn9rw&si=p7_1DoxHl0yhJRJH " . 


All the exercises i have done is the exercises he gave in his repository. 
This is his github for og source  "https://github.com/codebasics/py/tree/master/ML" 


I am doing all the codes in google colab and have downloaded as .ipynb. These are all working totally fine in colab might need to change somethings in other notebooks. I will upload both .ipynb file as well as .py file for simplicity.
